# Mandelbrot Explorer

This project uses p5.js to visualize [the Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) in an interactive fashion. [Here](https://atatrkgl.github.io/mandelbrot-explorer/) is the link to the site if you want to try it out.

## Controls

- *Scrollwheel:* Zoom in/out.
- *Left-click:* Center the mouse position.
- *Slider:* Changes the maximum allowed iterations. (Effects performance heavily.)
- *Resolution  Buttons:* Allows you to toggle between pixelated and detailed versions.

> Note that it is recommended to use the low-res mode while moving so the site can refresh more frequently, then you can activate the high-res mode to generate the detailed version.
